    <p>As the end of Homecoming week came to a close, hundreds of students, families, faculty and staff gathered to witness the Homecoming Parade and see how organizations represented the theme, “For My City,” as they walked down Merrick Drive.</p>
    <p>Over 50 organizations signed up to be a part of the parade, and seven of them had floats that will be judged as part of the Homecoming competition. The seven floats this year were assigned a decade to showcase how the University of Miami and the city of Miami were interdependent at the time.</p>

    <p>As a new member of the University of Miami family, President Julio Frenk was given a loud round of applause when he entered the stage for his welcome address to first-year students during orientation. Dr. Frenk and the students were both in the midst of their first official week as a Hurricane.</p>
    <p>The new president urged students to “embrace the life-changing spirit of discovery and take time to discover all we have to offer."</p>

    <p>The University of Miami is still transitioning into becoming an Adidas-sponsored school after being with Nike for 27 years, having officially begun their new licensing agreement on Sept. 1.</p>
    <p>Wednesday night Athletic Director Blake James met with USport, an organization for students who want futures in the sports industry, to explain the process of negotiating and deciding on the new deal that will last 12 years.</p>
    <p>About a year and a half ago, UM informed Nike with the decision to see what other brands would offer Miami, with the hopes of remaining with the brand despite exploring the market.</p>

    <p>A visitor was on the phone, trying to direct a friend to the fifth annual Lunar New Year Celebration on the Lakeside Patio. “Just find the white tents,” he said.</p>
    <p>The tents housed just part of Monday night’s festivities at the University of Miami that included food, entertainment, and an educational opportunity to learn about different countries in celebration of the Year of the Monkey on the Chinese calendar.</p>
    <p>Hosted by the Asian American Students Association, Hong Kong Students Association, and Chinese Students and Scholars Association, more than hundreds of students turned out for the event.</p>

    <img id="article-images" src="AblutionRoom.jpg" alt="Ablution Room UM" width="470" height="264">
    <p>When the ablution area was opened in March, students who had previously been using the Shalala Student Center for the ritual were pleased with the addition in the Storm Surge room.</p>
    <p>“I was ecstatic, it was so thoughtful for the school. It was phenomenal, no one was expecting it,” Imam said. “A lot of times we feel a little left out from the community so to see this… it showed they were meeting us in the middle.”</p>
    <p>Ablution can be performed in four steps or more but it generally begins with washing the face, the hands up to the elbows, the head and lastly, the feet up to the ankles. Now with a designated space, students can comfortably perform the ritual for prayer.</p>

    <p>Since when is Miami a doughnuts city? Not sure when the trend began, but follow the doughnut balloons that towered over The Wynwood Yard and step into a world of trays and trays of doughnuts.</p>
    <p>If you’re like me and you’re thinking ‘I thought doughnuts were whatever Dunkin Donuts has,’ then we’re both wrong.</p>
