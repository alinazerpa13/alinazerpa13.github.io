      <p>Since the day it was written on my birth certificate, I have carreid the name <strong>"Alina Lourdes Zerpa"</strong> with pride. It has helped me carry my mother's authenticity in my first name, my grandmother's spirit in my middle name, and my father's country in my last name. Born and raised in Miami, Fl., I grew up learning Spanish and English from my Cuban mother and Venezuelan father; to this day, they still argue about which country I represent more and, when it is most conveninent to me, I say American and walk away.</p>

      <p>As a current junior at the University of Miami, I have spent the last three years studying journalism and psychology. Besides interning at University Communications, I am also heavily involved on campus in different organizations such as Category 5, Great Start, the Department of Orientation and Commuter Student Involvement, Distraction and Homecoming Executive Committee. In my free time, I'm usually writing and hanging out with my godson.</p>

      <p>Although I'm not one to plan things out, I hope to one day write a book and become a successful reporter. Still unsure if I will live in Miami for the rest of my life but I know that I'll still be carrying around a pen and a notebook wherever I go.</p>
